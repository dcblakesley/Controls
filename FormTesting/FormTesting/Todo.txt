Changes in 1.0.12.x
 * moved away from utilizing bootstrap css classes such as form-group to using classes that start with edit- to avoid conflicts with other libraries
 * New Features
   - IsHidden to hide controls withough wrapping them in an if statement
   - Hiding allows hiding controls based on their own property for [Never, WhenReadonlyAndNull, WhenReadonly, etc.]
     -- This also exists within FormOptions, so the hiding can be controlled over a large group of controls.
 * Control Changes
   - EditRadio and EditCheckedList
     -- Change parameter from HasHorizontalButtons -> IsHorizontal
 * New Controls
   - EditRadioBool


   EditDisplay isn't working.
